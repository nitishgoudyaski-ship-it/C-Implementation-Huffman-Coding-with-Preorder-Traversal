# C-Implementation-Huffman-Coding-with-Preorder-Traversal
Assignment Description  This project implements Huffman Coding in C++ to generate prefix-free binary codes for a given set of characters and their frequencies. Unlike standard implementations that print mappings directly, this program prints the codes in preorder traversal of the Huffman tree, as required by the assignment specification.
